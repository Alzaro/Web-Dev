			<h2>Changing the Way We Teach Science</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp; Dr. Tyson has dedicated much of his Astrophysics career to changing the way we teach science in public schools, universities, and even in television shows.
					One of Tyson's more prominent ideas for change is completely overturning the way we fundamentally teach science to students.
					The idea isn't to subtract and replace the current studies, but rather, add to them to supplement the current cirriculum.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					" One of the things that I think is missing in the educational pipeline in America is… a class on what science is, and how and why it works. " <br /><br /><strong>- Dr.Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					&emsp; The above quote is one of Tyson's more prominent ideas. His thought process seems to be that science may be more interesting or easier to understand
					to students if they understood the fundamental thinking behind science as a whole before being exposed to more specific fields.
					<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; Tyson's ambitions for educating the current generation of students of science doesn't end with reforming the classroom.
					He's taken the reigns into his own hands in many ways. He has a podcast called <strong>'Star talk'</strong> where he has various, often celebrity, guests on
					and they talk about the mysteries of the Universe and potential answers to some of its most haunting questions. He also has starred as the host of the new T.V. series,
					'The Cosmos', a reinvention of the classic series hosted by Carl Sagan. Finally, he is the author of many educational books such as "Astrophysics for People in a Hurry" which 
					happens to be a favorite of mine.
					<br />
					<br />
					&emsp; All of this hardly scratches the surface of the work that Tyson is doing to better educate the current generation about science and the universe around them.
					I will leave you with this very fitting quote.
					<blockquote>
						" Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not. "<br /><br /> <strong>- Dr.Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong>
					</blockquote>
